Most of the site information can be found in the `config.yml` file. Just edit it to make changes.
By default, the site have the following sections:

- About - to describe what's the main goal of the workshop
- Speakers - to list information about speakers.
- Schedule - to show the agenda.
- Organizer - list of organizers

Ps: It's important to change the `baseurl` property from `config.yml` file in order to reflect your settings.

New images go into the static/img folder.
